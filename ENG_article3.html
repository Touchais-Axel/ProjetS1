    <figcaption>The three protagonists of the work</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> Sexism is present in all eras of humanity or
    almost. To illustrate this established fact, we will study the
    film "figures of the shadow" by Théodore Melfi (2016). This
    very good film takes place at the beginning of the 60s and relates
    the story of three African-American scientists working at
    The NASA. Despite the discrimination suffered by the system
    in place and by their male colleagues, our three
    protagonists allowed the United States to take the lead
    of the space conquest.
    The film also deals with racism, present in particular in
    through the segregationist treatment that was reserved for
    colored people. We will see that some words
    would be aberrant if they were held today but
    were the “norm” at that time. </p>

<h3 class="title">The woman, victim of clichés <br>
    members</h3>

<p class="p_title">In the 1960s, women fell prey to
    to sexist clichés of all kinds. They
    undergo, in their daily life,
    countless reductive remarks about
    their ability to perform the same tasks as
    men.
    <br>
    <br>
    A well-known example is driving
    automobile. A stereotype is that women
    drive less well than men, well
    let that be completely wrong. On time
    current, for example, 84% of managers
    fatal car accidents are
    conductors, not female conductors.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the film, it is precisely during a scene where
    the car of our 3 protagonists is broken down,
    that we are entitled to an obvious cliché. Indeed, a
    police officer checking them is surprised
    strongly that women work at NASA
    and participate in sending rockets into
    space. </p>

    <figure>
        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article3/screenshot1.webp" alt="Un policier contrôle les trois protagonistes">
        <figcaption>A policeman controls the three protagonists</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p> Beyond simple remarks, these pictures have
        an impact on the lives of women. In the middle
        professional for example.
        Indeed, the most important positions are
        occupied by men. Women are
        yet educated and competent but not
        can claim that in trades without
        risks and very mechanical.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the film, this inequality is felt at the
        NASA. Indeed, women are only entitled to
        simple jobs that have no major impact on
        a space mission, as "calculators"
        for example. These are responsible for
        check men's calculations.
        It's a very minimizing job when you know
        that they have the same intellectual capacities
        and skills than their male colleagues.
        <br>
        <br>
        Worse still, some sexist thoughts don't
        not allow women scientists to
        work properly.
        For example, most of the
        information present on the files they
        must be treated are confidential and crossed out
        with a black line, and they are not allowed to
        participate in meetings that would allow them
        to be efficient in their work. </p> 

    <figure>
        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article3/screenshot2.webp" alt="Les informations masquées d’un trait noir">
        <figcaption>Information masked with a black line</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>
    All of this forms a vicious cycle which, you
    you will understand, can only degrade the
    status and image of women in society.
    Alas, it doesn't end there. </p>

<h3 class="title">Racial segregation, a <br>
    additional discrimination</h3>

<p class="p_title">
    We have just seen how the ideology
    sexist impact on women's lives in ways
    negative, and on a daily basis. Unfortunately, this
    is not the only major discrimination
    ubiquitous at that time.
    <br>
    <br>
    In fact, in 1960, the United States separated the
    Caucasian whites and people of color:
    it is racial segregation.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to dividing men, it establishes a
    rejection and loathing of people of color, and
    this in their daily life. They must for example
    sit in the back of the bus so as not to
    mix with white people, don't
    cannot use the same fountains and
    toilets that they and do not have access to the same
    books in the library, which limits their knowledge. </p>

    <figure>
        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article3/screenshot3.webp" alt="Les fontaines sont séparées en fonction de la couleur de peau">
        <figcaption>The fountains are separated according to
            skin color</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p> In the film, this discrimination is illustrated
        by a big brake for our three protagonists.
        <br>
        <br>
        Where one does the work of a chef
        team but is refused a real
        promotion, the other is threatened with being
        fired because she needs a diploma
        only accessible in a white school
        and segregationist. And all this only "to
        cause ”of their skin color.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once again, these differences prevent
        people of color to flourish in a
        professional environment and forces them to work
        twice as hard to show their worth. </p>

<h3 class="title">A touch of hope</h3>

<p class="p_title">In all the darkness of this society that is
    plagued by deep inequalities, a few
    people stand out by realizing
    of the problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    In Theodore Melfi's work, this take
    consciousness is for example embodied by the
    NASA boss, who is very impressed with
    the genius and the work of our main heroine.
    He will then gradually help him against
    discriminations.
    <br>
    <br>
    One if not the most memorable scene of the
    film takes place around him. Our heroine, at
    end of nerves, will end up emptying his bag and
    explain all the inequalities to which it
    must cope during his working days.
    In particular, she must use the only toilets
    for people of color present on everything
    the campus, which are located 800 meters from its
    workplace, which wastes him a lot of time every day.
    <br>
    <br>
    Faced with his employee in tears, the manager
    decides to go and break the sign "toilets
    for women of color ”while saying
    the iconic phrase: "Here at NASA, we all piss
    the same color ”. </p>

    <figure>
        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article3/screenshot4.webp" alt="Le patron casse le panneau des toilettes pour femmes de couleurs">
        <figcaption>The boss breaks the toilet panel to
            women of color</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>While inequalities have always been present in
    the history of mankind, this scene we
    also shows that some people have,
    and will always have the courage to oppose it, and
    this for the good of all.</p>
