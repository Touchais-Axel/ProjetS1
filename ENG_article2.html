<p>Throughout history, there has been a lot of discrimination
    that made our teeth cringe. That they are of order
    ethnic, religious or even sexist, they all have
    brought their share of conflicts and victims. Among all that,
    groups of people were able to raise the point and say stop.
    These people fought for everyone to have the same
    rights. Here we will focus on two large figures
    of feminism: Rossiter and Joslyn Gage.
    They too, in their own way, had the courage to stand up
    against the trend for women to have the same
    freedoms and privileges than women.
    </p>

<h3 class="title">The Writer Who Fought <br>
    for their rights</h3>

<p class="p_title">Matilda Electa Joslyn Gage is female
    American born March 24, 1826 and died March 18
    March 1898.
    <br>
    <br>
    Already during her childhood, Joslyn Gage
    intervened against inequalities. She was helping by
    example the slaves present at the "Chemin de
    underground iron ”, network used by these
    last who fled to the free states of
    United States or Canada. This aid, which was
    formally banned at the time, he
    notably worth being imprisoned.</p>

        <figcaption>The Underground Railroad</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>In addition to being a writer, she was an abolitionist
    and supported the feminist movement with
    fervor. It is the proof that the movement
    already existed at that time, however distant.
    His major acts within this movement
    mainly concern obtaining the right
    vote by American women, something that
    was not possible until 1920 in the United States
    United.
    <br>
    <br>
    She began to take an interest in feminism by
    1852, when she spoke at the
    “Annual Convention on Women's Rights”,
    meeting aimed precisely at defending the
    of this female right to vote.
    <br>
    <br>
    To further support his position, Gage
    will even become president of the "National
    Woman Suffrage Association ”and head of
    executive committee for over 20 years.
    Finally, ultimate proof of its support for the
    women, the writer will sign the "Declaration of
    women's rights of the centenary of 1876 ”in
    company of feminist Lillie Devereux
    Blake.
    <br>
    <br>
    All these acts will eventually earn him his
    registration, in 1995, at the famous museum
    American, the National Women's Hall of Fame.</p>

<h3 class="title">The historian who teaches <br>
    their story</h3>

<p class="p_title">Margaret W. Rossiter was born in
    July 1944 and is still alive
    currently.
    The 77-year-old American is a teacher but
    also historian of science, subject
    which she teaches at Cornell University.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was at the famous Harvard University that she
    begins his long and tedious apprenticeship
    on the place of women in the history of
    sciences in the United States.
    <br>
    <br>
    While at Yale University,
    someone is going to give her something to think about
    will mark:
    "There are no women scientists at
    United States, but only assistants. "</p>

    <p>
        The researcher will then progressively
        seek to invalidate this sentence, by proving
        that there are women with the skills
        intellectuals all as remarkable as
        men in science, then
        by defending the rights of the latter to
        assert himself in the community.
        <br>
        <br>
        She did not know it yet but Rossiter, who has
        itself suffers from inequalities in view of its
        status of "woman scientist", will dedicate
        all his life to this cause.
        Among all her publications, the historian
        explained the phenomenon that made it worldwide
        know, "the Matilda effect".

    <p> These two figures have, each in its own way,
        each in its own time, contributed to improving
        women's living conditions. They are
        beaten so that women have the same
        rights than men. The difference of
        temporality that separates them proves that the fight
        it is and will remain timeless, at least as long as
        inequalities will not have totally
        missing. They are real examples to
        follow and their works have earned them
        honorable distinctions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many supporters of feminists
        help get things done by
        through works, whether literary,
        artistic or even cinematographic.
        For example, "Figures in the Shadows" is a
        film which also, in its own way, talks about
        inequalities suffered by women in the
        scientific domain.
