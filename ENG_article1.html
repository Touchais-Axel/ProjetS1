<h2 class="page_title">THE MATILDA EFFECT</h2>

<img class="banner_article" src="./img/article1/banner_article1.webp" alt="Bannière article 1">

<p>In the scientific field, the question of "to whom should
    return the merit of such or such a find ”comes back
    regularly, but remains essential.
    A scientist who gets credit as the author of a
    important discovery, may see its notoriety explode and its
    status change for the better.
    But conversely, a researcher only mentioned in
    thank you page, despite the hard work he has
    provided, will be forgotten. The progression of his career in
    will then be greatly slowed down.
    </p>

<h3 class="title">A phenomenon of inequalities</h3>

<p class="p_title">This quick explanation allows us
    to introduce the Matilda effect, which is the
    minimization of women's contribution
    scientists for the benefit of their colleagues
    male.</p>

        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article1/matilda_effect.webp" alt="Effet Matilda">
        <figcaption>The Matilda effect according to Wikipedia.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>This phenomenon is fully described and
    detailed in the 80s, by the scientist
    and feminist Margaret Rossiter, who is based on
    even on the work of several researchers.</p>

    <figure>
        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article1/margaret_rossiter.webp" alt="Margaret Rossiter">
        <figcaption>Margaret W. Rossiter</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>She first resumes the studies of the sociologist
    Robert King Merton.
    The latter understands that some scientists
    enjoy fame at the expense of
    their relatives, who nevertheless participated in
    project and therefore the creation of this same
    fame.
    In the 1960s, he established the "effect
    Mathieu ”, theory on inequitable distribution
    of glory.
    <br>
    <br>
    Rossiter realizes that the phenomenon
    mentioned by Merton is all the more amplified
    when the relatives in question are
    women.
    She then names this find
    "Matilda effect", in homage to the feminist and
    abolitionist Matlida Joslyn Gage.
    In her essay "Woman as an Inventor", published
    for the first time in 1870, the latter
    had already noticed in his time that the thought
    intellectual women was too often
    monopolized by men.</p>

<h3 class="title">Worrying cases</h3>

<p class="p_title">
    You should know that the Matilda effect is a
     phenomenon very present in the field
     scientific, regardless of the facet.
     On the IT side, for example, a statistic
     frightening tells us that in 1970, 59% of
     women are programmers in projects
     but only 7% are recognized as
     authors.
    <br>
    <br>
    Several examples support this statistic.
    <br>
    <br>
    Take the case of Jennifer Smith. At a
    project, this researcher was simply
    mentioned in the acknowledgments because it
    had “coded and competently executed
    calculations". Such a thing would not be possible
    today, because everyone knows that the code
    is a major job in writing a study.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another rather surprising example comes
    again confirm Rossiter's theory.
    Scientist Margaret Wu was also
    victim of this phenomenon.
    <br>
    <br>
    Indeed, she greatly helped to design a
    still widely used statistical tool
    today by scientists. The researcher
    Australian gets thanked in a
    1975 article for "help at work
    digital ”. The tool she created was named:
    "Watterson's estimator," according to the sole and
    sole author of the 1975 article: Watterson
    himself.
</p>

        <img class="illustration" src="./img/article1/wu.webp" alt="Margaret Wu">

    </figure>

<p>So we understand quite quickly when we see this
    that the work of the woman scientist was
    minimized for the benefit of the scientist.
</p>

<h3 class="title">A more complex problem <br>
    that it seems</h3>

<p class="p_title">If the Matilda effect is also present in
    scientific fields, this is partly for a
    very simple reason: There are no standards
    clear lines as to who is author and who is not.
    This is very problematic, because a speaker
    minor who sends some notes by email can
    be named an author, and conversely, a researcher
    who does tedious work may not be
    credited. A first thing to do for
    remedying this phenomenon would therefore be to
    determine clear rules for
    definition of authors.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, people have fought
    and always fight so that these inequalities
    disappear for good.
    Margaret Rossiter and Matilda Joslyn pledge,
    mentioned earlier, were and are among his
    people.
